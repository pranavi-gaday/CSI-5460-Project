ABSTRACT

The increasing effectiveness of AI-enhanced social engineering assaults is posing a new threat to cybersecurity. This study introduces a unique and cutting-edge countermeasure to these impending threats: Behavioral authentication enabled by artificial intelligence.
Advanced algorithms are used in AI-enhanced social engineering assaults to mimic human behavior and trick individuals into disclosing sensitive information or acting against their better judgment. Because of their more convincing and individualized character, traditional security measures frequently fall short of identifying these attacks.
In response to the changing threat landscape, this paper provides an in-depth examination of AI-powered behavioral authentication as a strong countermeasure. This innovative technology employs machine learning algorithms to assess user behavior patterns across digital interactions, resulting in a behavioral biometric profile that is unique to each individual.
Here we examine the benefits and drawbacks of applying AI-powered behavioral authentication, such as user privacy concerns, data collecting, and the necessity for robust authentication model security.
Furthermore, the paper addresses the role of regulations and standards in ensuring the responsible use of AI-powered behavioral authentication, emphasizing the importance of transparency and user consent.
INTRODUCTION
Information security has become one of the most critical concerns for organizations around the world.The use of digital technologies has brought about an increase in cyber threats, which poses a significant threat to organizations. 
Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems have become a necessity in maintaining a secure environment.The SIEM in detecting and responding to cyber threats.
Major functions of SIEM, such as log collection, analysis, correlation, and event management, are discussed in detail, emphasizing the need for organizations to adopt these security measures.
Despite the benefits, organizations implementing SIEM systems face several challenges.[1] Among these challenges include handling false alerts, managing SIEM systems, and understanding the associated risks.
By addressing these challenges, organizations can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their SIEM systems. In addition to SIEM systems, there are emerging technologies that organizations can use to detect potential threats.
[2]An AI-driven methodology for detecting anomalies in real-time data. The machine learning algorithms generate a model that can detect outliers in Apache Spark Streaming systems.
The results suggest that AI-based techniques can complement SIEM systems in identifying potential security threats. Furthermore, social engineering attacks have become a significant threat to organizations.
[3]there are various viewpoints of probabilistic risk assessment in artificial-enabled social engineering attacks. For effective mitigation strategies to deal with social engineering attacks that capitalize on human weaknesses to access confidential information.for conducting risk assessments to determine possible consequences and creating awareness programs to educate personnel on cybersecurity measures.
So the organizations should prioritize their cybersecurity efforts and adopt an integrated approach to secure their data from cyber threats. SIEM systems and AI-based methodologies can significantly enhance an organization's security posture, while effective risk assessment and comprehensive personnel education programs are essential in mitigating social engineering attacks to demonstrate the importance of a multi-layered approach for achieving comprehensive cybersecurity in the current digital age.[4],[5],[6].

MOTIVATION
Social engineers also may execute their attacks to gain information just out of curiosity towards the organization or certain information system without any malicious intent.Social engineers even do their operation as an intellectual challenge to satisfy their desire.
Revenge or personal grievance is one of the motive that moves social engineers who are usually former staff, business competitors or someone who does not agreed to that organization%E2%80%99s policies to damage the targeted organization%E2%80%99s reputation or business to satisfy their grudge towards that organization.
Social engineering may also operate based on political aspect where members from each political parties try to do social engineering attacks to gain critical information about their opposition or personal life information of their opposition%E2%80%99s leader and used it to damage their reputation or to against them in political war.Based on the theoretical framework, domain expert will identity the relevant risk component and using this concept they will map the specific artificial intelligence enabled social engineering risk.
It is true that we are producing more and more information and organizing them to seek better ways to extract knowledge. So, turning towards the advances in artificial intelligence. 
This is the technology that has come to help in many aspects of life such as simple machine learning, indicating the purchase of more practical uses such as in Data Security and financial prediction or speculation.

In the online environment, such as SNSs, susceptibility is the risk of falling victim to an attack performed through techniques such as phishing, spying, snooping or impersonation.  Susceptibility to social engineering can be defined as the extent to which a user would fall victim to social engineering trick. Victimization in information security refers to the breach, damage, disabling, or obstruction of an information system (including the user) that prevents the system from ensuring its availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and non-repudiation.  Some e-mail phishing studies (e.g., References [6,32%E2%80%9337]) have measured susceptibility to specific types of e-mail phishing attacks or have studied the effectiveness of one or more phishing countermeasures in relation to some demographic factors. The difference between our study and those studies is that our focus is on social engineering on Facebook, and not using e-mail. Social engineering on Facebook involves several other techniques, such as posts, tags, applications, games, impersonation using fake profiles, and even interactive persuasion using chatting or messaging.




NOTE: Here we have used various reference for our research and background work on the paper. Our further work will be on our approach emphasizing behaviour analysis, anamoly detection, security management and event Ingration and certain machine learning models.
